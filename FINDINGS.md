# Key Findings from Wage & Gold Price Analysis

## 1. Wage Purchasing Power in Gold Paradox (2013-2025)

While Poland's minimum wage increased dramatically from **1,600 PLN (2013) to 4,666 PLN (2025)** — a **191% increase** — the purchasing power in terms of gold tells a different story:

- **Peak purchasing power**: 2014 with **13.11 grams of gold** per minimum wage
- **Current purchasing power (2025)**: Only **11.75 grams of gold** per minimum wage
- **Net loss in gold purchasing power**: ~10.4% despite nominal wage growth

**Interpretation**: Although nominal wages more than doubled, rising gold prices (from 128 PLN/g to 397 PLN/g) have eroded the real purchasing power of minimum wages when measured in terms of precious metals. This suggests that wage increases have not kept pace with asset price inflation.

## 2. Data Sources

- **Minimum Wages**: Eurostat API (earn_mw_cur dataset) - European Statistical Office
- **Gold Prices**: National Bank of Poland (NBP) - Historical daily prices aggregated to annual averages
- **Time Period**: 2013-2025 (13 years of data)

## 3. Methodology Notes

- Minimum wage data is aggregated from semi-annual (S1, S2) to annual averages
- Gold prices are in PLN per gram (1000 proof standard)
- Wage-in-gold calculation: Annual minimum wage (PLN) ÷ Annual average gold price (PLN/g)
