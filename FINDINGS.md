# Key Findings from Wage & Gold Price Analysis

## 1. Wage Purchasing Power in Gold Paradox (2013-2025)

While Poland's minimum wage increased dramatically from **1,600 PLN (2013) to 4,666 PLN (2025)** — a **191% increase** — the purchasing power in terms of gold tells a different story:

- **Peak purchasing power**: 2014 with **13.11 grams of gold** per minimum wage
- **Current purchasing power (2025)**: Only **11.75 grams of gold** per minimum wage
- **Net loss in gold purchasing power**: ~10.4% despite nominal wage growth

**Interpretation**: Although nominal wages more than doubled, rising gold prices (from 128 PLN/g to 397 PLN/g) have eroded the real purchasing power of minimum wages when measured in terms of precious metals. This suggests that wage increases have not kept pace with asset price inflation.

## 2. Average Wage Purchasing Power in Gold (2013-2023)

Average wages (full-time adjusted salary per employee) show a similar pattern:

- **2013**: 44,310 PLN = 308.61 grams of gold
- **2023**: 81,999 PLN = 312.75 grams of gold
- **Nominal growth**: +85% in PLN terms
- **Real growth in gold**: Only +1.3% (essentially flat)

**Key observation**: Despite an 85% nominal wage increase, workers could buy virtually the same amount of gold in 2023 as in 2013. The zloty has been devalued by approximately the same percentage that wages increased, leaving real purchasing power against hard assets unchanged.

## 3. Gold vs Wage Growth Comparison

- **Minimum wage growth (2013-2025)**: +192%
- **Average wage growth (2013-2023)**: +85%
- **Gold price growth (2013-2025)**: +177%
- **Gold price growth (2013-2023)**: +83%

Gold and average wages grew at nearly identical rates (both ~83% from 2013-2023), meaning the ratio stayed constant. This suggests both nominal wages and gold prices have been inflating at similar rates in PLN terms.

**Winners vs Losers**: 
- Someone who held gold since 2013 maintained their wealth relative to workers' wages
- Workers saw their wages grow nominally but real purchasing power (in terms of hard assets) remained stagnant

## 5. Methodology Notes

- Minimum wage data is aggregated from semi-annual (S1, S2) to annual averages
- Gold prices are in PLN per gram (1000 proof standard)
- Wage-in-gold calculation: Annual minimum wage (PLN) ÷ Annual average gold price (PLN/g)
